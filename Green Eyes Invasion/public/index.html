                <p>Here, your objective is to use the cannon balls inside the black square to hit all the elements on screen. You accumulate score on each level you complete. 
                The green Eyes are the ones you should eliminate to complete the level. There are also red TNT sqare that it will give you a bonus if you destroy them.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Use the mouse to drag the cannon ball as if it was a slingshot. The cannon will shoot the bullet in the oposite direction (You can also bounce it to the floor for a better angle). 
                If you want to play more levels, you can load your own ones and access to them with the "Skip Button", just take into account that skipping a level will not add you score.</p>
